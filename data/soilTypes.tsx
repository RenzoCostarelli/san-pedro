    description:
      "These soils were formed by the decomposition of transported colluvial deposits, originating from distant areas of alluvial fans and the lower slopes of surrounding hills. They are primarily found at the edges of the vineyard and exhibit a variety of fine sedimentation with high levels of silt and clay, along with scattered rocky fragments. This composition explains the high levels of electrical conductivity observed in these soils.",

    title: "Balanced Coluvial",
    description:
      "These soils were formed from the breakdown of transported colluvial deposits, originating in nearby and mid-range areas of alluvial fans. They are distributed from the higher parts of the vineyard to more distant areas, following a central pattern within the vineyard. These soils consist of a balanced mix of fine sediments (silt, sand, and clay) and moderate-sized rocky fragments, predominantly andesites and granodiorites. Their proximity to drainage channels helps distribute coarse fragments over longer distances. This composition explains why they exhibit intermediate levels of electrical conductivity on the conductivity map.",

    title: "Rocky Coluvial",
    description:
      "These soils were formed in the area closest to the apex or proximal zone of an alluvial fan, where the transporting channel rapidly loses energy and deposits heavier sediment loads. This soil type is specifically identified in pit Al-07, characterized by a high proportion of large, sub-angular fragments of andesite and granodiorite (10-40 cm), which make up over 60% of the total soil. The finer fraction, consisting mainly of silt and clay, is less abundant and contributes to the low conductivity values shown on the CEM conductivity map.",

    title: "Balanced Fluvial",
    description:
      "These soils are found in an isolated patch in the center of the vineyar. They formed from the breakdown of sediments deposited along the banks of a low-energy river channel unable to carry larger fragments. Being disconnected from the main river channel, they're interpreted as abandoned sediment deposits linked to an old branch of the Calabozo stream. These soils initially described as a mix of river and colluvial sediments (angular and rounded fragments). Later, it was found that rounded, well-selected fragments dominate, with a pseudo-layering between gravel and sandy sediments low in silt and clay. This results in low to medium electromagnetic conductivity values.",

    title: "Fluvial with Matrix Dominance",
    description:
      "Soils associated with this unit evolved from sediments deposited by the moderate-energy Calabozo Stream, similar to the previous unit. These soils are centrally distributed within the vineyard, they feature a balanced mix of fine fractions (sands, silts, and limited clays) and coarser fragments (sub-rounded, 2 to 20 cm, predominantly andesites and similar intrusive rocks from the vineyard hills). These fragments constitute between 40% and 60% of the total soil volume, contributing to the low electrical conductivity values recorded near the stream, attributed to their low clay content.",

The soil in this area, shows different levels of decomposition ranging from a surface sediment of light brown to light gray color, rich in silt and clay with little organic matter, to deeper zones with a sandy texture and the presence of clays derived from the decomposition of feldspars and micas from the original rock.",
